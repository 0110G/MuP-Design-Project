# MuP-Design-Project
Soda Dispensing Machine Design done as a part of Second Year Computer Science Course : Microprocessors and Interfacing (CS-F241)

# Problem Statement
Make a Soda Dispencing Machine that can dispence three different types of drinks in three different quantities : Small, Medium and Large. There are buttons to select cold drink and sizes. LED's are available with each button. Whenever choice is made and user enters the required number of coins, corresponding LED's glow and dispencing is done. The machine cancels dispencing in cases when the drink is not available in sufficient quantity or the incorrect number of coins are entered. There are LED's to indicate those too.
